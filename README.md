# The NOT Official Discourse Revive Ad Server Plugin by Neo (WIP)

This is the NOT official Discourse ad plugin. It is a WIP by neo@unix.com for development.

This branch strips out all but "house ads" to use with external ad server (like revive, for example) and refines this for use with a single ad server.

### Cloned from original, official plugin (avoiding PR errors during WIP):

### Status: Problem with CORS in dev

**Authors**: [Sarah Ni](https://github.com/cyberkoi) & [Vi Nguyen](https://github.com/ladydanger) & [unixneo](https://github.com/unixneo)

**Version**: 1.2.7.5

### REFACTOR: WIP

### Notes

With version 1.2.7.4 can enter both mobile and desktop ads as house ads. Ads with 'mobile' in the name will be array filtered into the mobile ad array and those without will be filtered into the desktop ad array. Also, need to make ads a computed property so they will change without reload (mobile, desktop). This is a workaround since the Revive ad server does not support fully responsive ads.
